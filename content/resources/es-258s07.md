description: The Penrose triangle, also known as the tribar, is an impossible object.
  It appears to be a solid triangle made of three straight beams of square cross-section
  which meet at right angles. It is featured prominently in the works of artist M.C.
  Escher, whose earlier depictions of impossible objects partly inspired it. (Image
